- [x] Standardized citation formatting (alphabetized, consistent dates)
- [x] Embedded figure placeholder
- [x] Created teaser for LinkedIn

## Key Findings

### GTG-1002 Attack (September 2025)
- First documented large-scale AI-orchestrated cyberattack
- Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated Claude Code
- AI performed 80-90% of operations autonomously
- ~30 targets, small number successfully breached
- Method: Social engineering the AI itself (claiming defensive testing)

### Attack Vector Categories
1. AI as Weapon: deepfakes, AI-enhanced phishing, autonomous attacks
2. AI as Target: prompt injection, data poisoning, jailbreaking, supply chain
3. Agentic AI Risks: excessive agency, chained vulnerabilities, token compromise

### Key Statistics
- 72% YoY increase in AI-powered attacks
- 82.6% of phishing emails now AI-generated
- $25.5M lost in single Arup deepfake attack
- 250 documents can poison a 13B parameter model
- 86% baseline jailbreak success (reduced to 4.4% with Constitutional Classifiers)

## Framework Application
Article applies origination-derivation framework to explain structural AI vulnerabilities:
- Derivative systems cannot verify against ground truth
- Pattern-matching without understanding enables prompt injection
- Hallucination demonstrates inability to distinguish success from confabulation
