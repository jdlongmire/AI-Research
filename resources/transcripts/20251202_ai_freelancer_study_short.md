Everyone keeps saying AI is going to take our jobs. Okay, let's actually put that to the test. Researchers gave the world's smartest AI agents $144,000 worth of real projects and said, "Automate this." And what came next was an absolute disaster.

A team from the Center for AI Safety collected 240 freelance projects. These are real projects that humans got paid for. We're talking architecture design, video editing, mini game development, 3D modeling, data dashboards, and many other ones. Again, real professional work ranging from $9 to $22,000 per project.

And they took the world's smartest AI agents from GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Grok 4, the same systems that supposedly passed the bar exam and ACE medical licensing assessments, and their performance was a nightmare.

The best AI agents after trying everything only successfully completed 2.5% of the work. That means it failed 97% of the time. So out of the $144,000 worth of projects, it earned $1,700.

And when researchers looked at why these AI agents failed, they found patterns of incompetence. 8-second videos when the project asked for 8 minutes, childlike stick figure drawings for professional graphics. 3D buildings that looked completely different from every angle and robotic voices that sounded terrible.

Nearly half of all AI attempts produced work so unprofessional that it wouldn't pass a high school project review.

So these AI agents crushed every benchmark test. But the moment you give them real economically valuable work, you get 2.5% of success.

So, the gap between AI can use a computer and AI can autonomously do your job isn't a gap. It's more of a canyon in between.

Follow and I'll keep you posted.
