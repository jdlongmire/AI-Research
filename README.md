# AI Research

Independent research, commentary, and analysis on artificial intelligence.

## Purpose

This repository collects articles, research materials, and tools for understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and implications. The goal is rigorous, evidence-based analysis that avoids both hype and dismissal.

## Current Focus

**The Origination-Derivation Framework**

A theoretical lens for understanding AI limitations: the distinction between human origination (accessing configurations not derived from prior inputs) and AI derivation (transforming prior inputs according to learned patterns). This framework is being developed to explain documented AI phenomena including hallucination, reasoning failures, brittleness, and creativity constraints.

See [AI-Research-Program.md](AI-Research-Program.md) for the full theoretical program.
