# AI Limitations and Opportunities Research Program

A framework for understanding artificial intelligence through the origination-derivation distinction.

## Overview

This research program investigates AI capabilities and limitations through a novel theoretical lens: the claim that human cognition has access to two coexistent primitive systems (Infinite Information Space and the three fundamental laws of logic) while AI systems are categorically derivative, operating downstream of human-generated data.

**Central Question:** What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and can these be understood through a principled framework grounded in the distinction between origination and derivation?

## The Core Distinction

| | Origination | Derivation |
|---|-------------|------------|
| **Process** | Retrieving configurations not derived from prior inputs | Transforming prior inputs according to learned patterns |
| **Causal chain** | Includes something entering from outside prior experience | Runs inputs → processing → outputs with no external entry |
| **Access** | Human cognition | AI systems |

This distinction is structural, not a claim about intelligence or consciousness.

## Research Areas

The program examines six categories of documented AI phenomena:

1. **Hallucination** - Why elimination may be mathematically impossible
2. **Reasoning Failures** - Structural limits on logical reasoning
3. **Brittleness** - Out-of-distribution failure patterns
4. **Stochastic Parrot Problem** - Statistical patterns without grounding
5. **Scaling Limits** - Diminishing returns from scale alone
6. **Creativity Ceilings** - Constraints on novelty generation

## Engagement

This is a research program in development. If you work in AI, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, or related fields, engagement is welcome.
