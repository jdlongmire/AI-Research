**What Can AI Actually Do?**

The AI conversation has become polarized: breathless AGI predictions on one side, dismissive hype-calling on the other. Both miss something fundamental.

I've started a research program investigating a simple distinction: *origination* vs. *derivation*. Humans can make genuine leaps beyond prior inputs. AI systems transform what they've seen. This isn't about intelligence or consciousness—it's about what kind of process is occurring.

Recent research on hallucination, reasoning failures, brittleness, and creativity ceilings may point toward structural limits, not just engineering problems to solve.

This framework isn't anti-AI. Derivation is genuinely valuable. The key is understanding which tasks require which kind of process.

I'm sharing this publicly to invite engagement. If you see flaws, tell me. If you know relevant research, point me to it.
