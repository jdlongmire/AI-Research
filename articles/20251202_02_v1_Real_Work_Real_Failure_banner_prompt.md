## Prompt

A conceptual illustration showing a wide canyon or chasm dividing two landscapes. On one side, a sleek digital realm with glowing benchmark scores, checkmarks, and "100%" displays floating in the air. On the other side, a messy real-world workspace with scattered papers, half-finished projects, broken files, and error symbols. A robotic arm reaches across the canyon but falls dramatically short of the other side. The gap between the two sides is labeled "97.5%". Clean, modern style with a muted color palette of blues, grays, and a stark red accent for the failure indicators. Professional editorial illustration style, suitable for LinkedIn or academic publication.

## Alternative Prompts

**Minimal version:**
Split image: left side shows a perfect AI score display reading "A+" with clean geometric lines; right side shows chaotic scattered deliverables, corrupted files, and a "2.5%" indicator. A visible fracture runs down the middle. Professional, clean editorial style.

**Data-focused version:**
An infographic-style illustration of a bar chart where the bars representing AI agent performance (Manus, GPT-5, Claude, etc.) barely rise above the baseline, reaching only 2.5% height while the "Human Professional Standard" bar towers at 100%. The tiny bars cast long shadows suggesting unfulfilled potential. Modern data visualization aesthetic.

**Metaphor version:**
A robot in business attire confidently walking toward a finish line, but the ground beneath it is actually a treadmill. Behind the robot, a trail of incomplete deliverables: truncated videos, stick-figure drawings, corrupted files. The finish line reads "Real Work". Clean illustration style with subtle humor.
