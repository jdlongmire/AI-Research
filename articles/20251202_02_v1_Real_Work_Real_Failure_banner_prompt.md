## Prompt

A split-panel editorial illustration contrasting client requirements with AI deliverables. Left panel labeled "REQUIRED": a professional architectural rendering, an 8-minute video timeline, polished graphic design mockups, a coherent 3D building model. Right panel labeled "DELIVERED": a childlike stick figure drawing, an 8-second video snippet, corrupted file icons, a 3D building that looks completely different from three angles shown. Between the panels, a large "97.5% FAILURE" indicator. The contrast should be stark and sobering: professional expectations on the left, amateur or broken output on the right. Clean editorial style, muted blues and grays with red failure indicators.

## Alternative Prompts

**Side-by-side comparison:**
A triptych showing three project types. Each has "Brief" on top and "Delivered" below. First: client brief shows "8-minute explainer video" / delivered shows a tiny 8-second progress bar. Second: brief shows "professional logo design" / delivered shows crude stick figures. Third: brief shows "3D architectural model" / delivered shows the same building looking like three completely different structures from different angles. Clean infographic style with a "2.5% Success Rate" caption.

**The inspection table:**
A quality control inspector's table viewed from above. On the left, a neat stack of professional project briefs with clear requirements. On the right, a rejection pile overflowing with: empty file folders, truncated videos, corrupted downloads, inconsistent 3D renders, amateur drawings. A stamp reading "WOULD NOT PASS HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW" sits prominently. 45.6% of the pile is marked "Quality Failure." Documentary photography style, desaturated.

**The gap visualization:**
Two monitors side by side. Left monitor displays "What the client paid $22,000 for" showing a polished professional deliverable. Right monitor displays "What AI delivered" showing an obviously incomplete, corrupted, or amateur version of the same project. A price tag reading "$0 earned" hangs from the right monitor. The left monitor glows with professional competence; the right flickers with error messages. Tech editorial illustration style.
