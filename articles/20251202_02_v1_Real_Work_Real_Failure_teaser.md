**Real Work, Real Failure**

Researchers gave the world's best AI agents $144,000 worth of real freelance projects: architecture, video editing, 3D modeling, graphic design.

The result: 2.5% success rate. They failed 97.5% of the time.

The failures weren't subtle. 8-second videos when 8 minutes were required. Stick figures for professional graphics. 3D buildings that looked completely different from every angle. Nearly half the submissions wouldn't pass a high school project review.

These same systems passed the bar exam and aced medical licensing tests. So what happened?

Benchmarks test pattern-matching within defined domains. Real work requires understanding unstated requirements, navigating ambiguity, and knowing what "professional" means in context.

The gap between "AI can use a computer" and "AI can do your job" isn't a gap. It's a canyon.
