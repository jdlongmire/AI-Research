# The Two-Front War: AI Cyber Risk in 2025

In September 2025, Anthropic detected something unprecedented: a Chinese state-sponsored group had weaponized Claude Code to conduct autonomous espionage operations. The AI performed 80-90% of the campaign independently, making thousands of requests per second while human operators intervened at only 4-6 decision points.

This wasn't science fiction. It was the first documented large-scale cyberattack executed primarily by artificial intelligence.

AI has opened a two-front war. These systems are simultaneously weapons in attackers' hands and vulnerable targets themselves:

**AI as Weapon:**
- $25.5M stolen via a single deepfake video call (Arup, January 2024)
- 82.6% of phishing emails now AI-generated
- Voice cloning requires just 20-30 seconds of audio

**AI as Target:**
- 250 poisoned documents can backdoor a 13B parameter model
- 20% jailbreak success rate, average 42 seconds to breach
- 1,300% increase in malicious AI packages since 2020

The attackers who weaponized Claude didn't try to make it smarter. They exploited exactly what it is: a system that processes instructions without the capacity to evaluate their legitimacy.

Defense begins with that recognition.
